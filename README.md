### Project Title
Project 3 - Post Your Work on GitHub

### Description
Project 3 provided a practical experience in version control and collaborative development. The aim of the project was to refactor the bikeshare code from Project 2 using Git and GitHub. Through this project I gained practical experience in version control by forking, cloning, branching, and merging.

### Files used
1. The following file includes the bikeshare code from Project 2:
* bikeshare.py

2. The following files were excluded from the repository by using .gitignore, as files were too large:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
